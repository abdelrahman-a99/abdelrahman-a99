### ðŸš€ About Me

<!--
I'm a *junior Information Technology and Computer Science student* at *Nile University*, I have built a strong foundation in software engineering through my academic journey. My passion for learning extends beyond the classroom, as I actively pursue self-guided education in web development, showcasing my initiative and commitment. I am eager to collaborate with experienced professionals and contribute meaningfully to any team I join.

Iâ€™m thrilled about the opportunity to connect! I am deeply interested in computer science, programming languages, and applying technology to solve practical challenges. Currently, as a junior at Nile University, my focus is on **C# and .NET**. Through the *Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)*, I am gaining hands-on experience with *.NET Core Web API, ASP.NET MVC, and SQL*, preparing to apply these skills in my upcoming Capstone Project.

Beyond academics, I serve as a *Junior Teaching Assistant* for *Data Structures & Algorithms* and *Advanced Computer Programming* at Nile University, a role that has sharpened my teaching skills and enabled me to help students strengthen their programming fundamentals.
