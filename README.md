### ðŸš€ About Me

I'm a **junior Information Technology and Computer Science student** at **Nile University**, passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. My academic journey, combined with self-guided learning, has provided me with a solid foundation in **software engineering and web development**.

Currently, I am deepening my expertise in **C# and .NET technologies** through the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**, gaining hands-on experience with **.NET Core Web API, ASP.NET MVC, and SQL**. This training is preparing me for my upcoming **Capstone Project**.

Beyond academics, I serve as a **Junior Teaching Assistant** for **Data Structures & Algorithms** and **Advanced Computer Programming** at Nile University, a role that has strengthened my problem-solving and mentoring skills.

Iâ€™m eager to collaborate, learn, and contribute to impactful projects. Let's connect and create something amazing together! ðŸš€
